The slides are really good, you can look at them first to save time, and then look at the video for parts you didn't understand.


**Assignment 1**

**Deadline - 23rd December**

Part 1  - Complete the ipynb file provided. 

Topics covered : 

1)Count based word vectors : Co-occurence matrices, dimensionality reduction by truncated SVD, plotting embeddings 

2)Comparison with prediction based word vector GloVe  

3)Similarity : Cosine similarility, synonyms, antonyms, thinking about Bias  

Part 2 - Complete files **sgd.py** and **word2vec.py**

Topics covered :

1)Skipgram implmentation with Naive Softmax 

2)Skipgram implmentation with negative sampling

For part 2 you can take help of this Medium Article by Shubham Shrivastava:

A minor hiccup wrt part 2 : I could not pass the test cases for the part of Skipgram implmentation with negative sampling. I have not changed the test cases yet, but if we all face the same issue then we can confirm that the test cases are not correct. I'll try it out again. But once you do it, let me know if you were able to pass those test cases.
